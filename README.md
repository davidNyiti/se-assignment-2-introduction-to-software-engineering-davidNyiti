Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.
traditonal programing involves primarly to write computer code, but they also test codes, update codes and create script. Software engineering are involved with all aspects of software creation, including concept, design and coding.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Answers:
the following are various phases of software development
Requirements Analysis: This phase involves understanding and documenting what the users need from the software. It includes gathering functional and non-functional requirements and ensuring they are clear, complete, and consistent.

Design: In this phase, the software's architecture is designed. This includes high-level design, which outlines the system architecture, and detailed design, which focuses on the individual components. Design models and diagrams (like UML diagrams) are often used.

Implementation (Coding): During implementation, the software design is translated into source code using programming languages. This phase also involves unit testing to verify that each component functions correctly.

Testing This phase involves verifying and validating the software to ensure it meets the requirements. Different levels of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

Deployment: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment where users can start using it. Deployment can involve installing the software, configuring it for the environment, and providing user training.

Maintenance: Post-deployment, software requires regular maintenance to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance. Maintenance is an ongoing process and can include corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance.
